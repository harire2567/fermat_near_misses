###Fermat's Last Theorem Near Misses Search Program###
This repository contains an executable file along with its source code that searches for "near misses" of Fermat's Last Theorem in the form 
x^n + y^n <> z^n. The program prompts the user to enter the values of n (the power) and k (which limits x and y) and systematically searches for combinations of x, y, and z that are close to satisfying the equation. It calculates the relative miss for each combination and outputs the smallest near miss and relative miss encountered. The user can examine the output on the screen.

#Prerequisites
To run this program, you need to have Python installed on your system.
